# Codex Agent Instructions — DIMPIK

Read **`PRODUCT_SPEC.md`** before changing code. That file is the source of truth for product decisions and acceptance criteria.

## Mission

Maintain and improve **DIMPIK (딤픽)**, the renamed Windows 10/11 screen capture and annotation editor. Deliver a stable, professional, minimalist, **original** Windows UI with multi-tab capture and rich annotation workflows.

## Naming migration (first task)

Current implementation originated as **ACapdo v0.8**, then ASnapdo. Rename identifiers and assets to DIMPIK consistently (assembly, root namespace, filenames, publish scripts, app data path, title, log prefix and documentation) while preserving ACapdo and ASnapdo user settings and sessions through a deliberate migration. Keep encrypted session compatibility and migrate the existing auto-start entry. Do not consider the rename completed solely because these documents use the new name.

## Repository baseline

- C# / .NET 8 / Windows Forms (initial v0.8 source).
- Project file: `src/DIMPIK/DIMPIK.csproj`.
- Build: `dotnet build src/DIMPIK/DIMPIK.csproj -c Release` on Windows.
- Publish: run `build-exe.cmd` on Windows; output `release\app\DIMPIK.exe` (native resident launcher) and `release\app\editor\` (editor EXE/DLL). Build the installer with `build-installer.ps1`; output `release\setup\dimpik_inst_x64_1.0.5.exe`. Default installation is Program Files\DIMPIK and requires administrator approval. See PRODUCT_SPEC.md for the idle memory budget and session lifecycle.
- Visual reference: `docs/design/ui-concept-reference.png` (concept, not an actual application screenshot).
- The DIMPIK editor was built and smoke-tested on Windows on 2026-11-08. Native tray and installer artifacts still require rebuild and validation before release.

## Non-negotiable functional requirements

1. Region and full-screen capture with **configurable global hotkeys** (default Print Screen and Ctrl+Shift+1). Handle registration conflicts safely; don't claim to know which process owns a key.
2. Every new capture creates an independent tab titled `yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss.png`, with `×` close control, unsaved marker, and unsaved-changes confirmation.
3. `Ctrl+C` copies **composited active-tab image** to the system clipboard, except when text editing is focused.
4. `Ctrl+Shift+C` copies all annotation objects into an app-local buffer; `Ctrl+Alt+C` copies selected annotation; `Ctrl+Shift+V` pastes onto another capture tab. This must not overwrite the destination image.
5. Annotation objects are individually selectable, movable, resizable, deletable, and undoable. Preserve image-relative coordinates independent of zoom.
6. `Ctrl+mouse wheel` zooms the editor; fit to screen via Ctrl+0.
7. Tray minimize is quiet: **no large/repeated balloon notifications**; at most a discreet one-time message. Closing the window should not silently terminate the tray-resident app; tray Exit really exits.
8. Recent thumbnail/gallery strip remains hidden by default and optional.
9. Preserve capture/editor feature set and use the DIMPIK name. Publisher/company is AAStudio.kr. The license is free for individuals, businesses and public institutions; LICENSE.txt is the shared installer/help license text. Keep the compact app header as logo + 딤픽 DIMPIK; use the tagline “Capture · Edit · Share”.

## UI rules

- Independent layout: top compact actions, document tabs, narrow left tools, dominant central canvas, contextual right inspector, slim bottom status bar.
- Visually clean and premium: whitespace, consistent spacing, restrained blue `#2563EB`, soft neutrals, minimal decoration.
- Use DIMPIK's original layouts, interaction patterns, and icons. Do not copy proprietary assets.
- Choose WinForms incremental improvement or staged WPF shell migration based on regression risk; explain the choice. Never discard working functionality merely for a UI rewrite.
- Design must work at Windows 125%, 150%, 200% DPI and narrow widths.

## Engineering workflow

1. Inspect current code; list verified behavior and any existing failures.
2. Make small, coherent commits/steps and keep project buildable.
3. Separate capture/document/annotation/clipboard/hotkey responsibilities where practical; avoid growing `MainForm.cs` monolith.
4. For image manipulation: dispose Bitmaps/Graphics safely; marshal UI updates to UI thread; avoid leaking GDI handles or touching disposed tabs.
5. Keep image clipboard contents and internal annotation buffer separate.
6. Check shortcut interactions with focused text inputs and system-reserved key combinations.
7. Test save naming collisions, mixed-DPI displays, multiple tabs, dirty close, background capture, and destination images with different sizes.
8. Run build and tests when a Windows SDK environment exists; otherwise state precise limitations and do not fabricate test results.

## Release and deployment rules

- Every deployment must create a versioned GitHub Release in `mant81/DIMPIK` and attach the matching Windows installer (`dimpik_inst_x64_<version>.exe`). A source-only tag or release is not a completed deployment.
- Automatically include the current version's `CHANGELOG.md` section and GitHub-generated release notes. Use `publish-release.ps1` after building the installer and committing/pushing the release source.
- Keep the editor, native launcher, installer, product documentation and download links on the same version. Never replace an existing published version with different binaries; increment the version.
- Build and run relevant checks before publishing. Create the release as a draft, upload and verify the installer asset, then publish. Report the release URL, installer path and SHA-256.
- Never commit signing keys or access tokens. Release publishing uses `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` or the configured Git credential helper without printing credentials.

## Acceptance and communication

Follow P0 → P1 → P2 checklists in `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`. After changes report files modified, build/test commands and actual results, artifacts, remaining blockers, and screenshot(s) of the running UI when possible. Do not present concept images as real application screenshots.
